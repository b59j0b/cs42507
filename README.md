Economics 496: Undergraduate Thesis Seminar II
Spring 2024
Description:
The economics distinction program provides a challenging, yet supportive   environment   for students to produce an original thesis in economics.      In   Thesis   Seminar   I,   students   will learn the paradigm for empirical research, identify an appropriate research   topic,   and   conduct their empirical analyses.    In Thesis   Seminar II, students   will   refine   their   empirical analyses, learn the keys to effective writing, write their theses, and present their   work to the economics faculty, staff,   and students.      Students   who   do   not   complete   Seminar I satisfactorily will not be given permission to enroll in   Seminar II.
